I am an Associate Professor and the Ph.D. Coordinator of Operations and Information Management at the School of Business, University of Connecticut. I received my Ph.D. in *Operations, Information and Decisions* from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and my M.E. in *Computer Science* from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research leverages empirical data to study the societal and economic impact of emerging phenomena fueled by technology innovations in online platforms, including e-commerce, social media, gig economy, digital health, and human-AI interaction. Beyond applied empirical work, I am deeply engaged in developing methodologies to address common statistical challenges in empirical research.

My work has appeared in premier journals such as *Information Systems Research*, *Journal of Marketing Research*, *Management Science*, and *MIS Quarterly*. My research has won multiple best paper awards, including the Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE) best paper award, the INFORMS Social Media Analytics Student Best Paper Runner-up award, the INFORMS eBusiness Section Best Paper Runner-Up award, and the ACM CHI conference Best Paper Honorable Mention. I have also been recognized with the Gordon B. Davis Young Scholar Award and the Sandra A. Slaughter Early Career Award from the INFORMS Information Systems Society.
