I am an Associate Professor and the Ph.D. Coordinator of Operations and Information Management at the School of Business, University of Connecticut. I received my Ph.D. in *Operations, Information and Decisions* from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and my M.E. in *Computer Science* from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research primarily uses empirical data to study the social and economic impact of emerging phenomena driven by technology innovations in online platforms, such as social media, e-commerce, gig economy, and digital health platforms. In addition to empirical research, I also have a keen interest in developing novel econometric methods to address statistical challenges facing empirical researchers.

My work has appeared in premier journals such as *Information Systems Research*, *Journal of Marketing Research*, *Management Science*, and *MIS Quarterly*. My research has won multiple best paper awards, including the Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE) best paper award, the INFORMS Social Media Analytics Student Best Paper Runner-up award, the INFORMS eBusiness Section Best Paper Runner-Up award, and the ACM CHI conference Best Paper Honorable Mention. I am also a recipient of the INFORMS Information Systems Society Gordon B. Davis Young Scholar Award.
